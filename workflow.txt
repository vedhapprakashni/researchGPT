1. Upload → User uploads a PDF research paper
2. Process → Backend extracts text, detects sections, chunks content
3. Embed → Each chunk is embedded using BGE-base embedding model
4. Store → Vectors stored in Pinecone with metadata (page, section)
5. Query → User asks a question
6. Retrieve → Semantic search finds relevant chunks
7. Generate → LLM generates answer with citations
8. Display → Response shown with page references

## Inspiration

Researchers and students spend countless hours reading dense academic papers, often struggling to quickly find specific information or understand complex concepts. We were inspired to create a tool that makes research papers interactive - allowing users to have a conversation with their documents instead of manually scanning through pages.

## What it does

ResearchGPT is an AI-powered research assistant that lets you:

- Upload PDF research papers and have them automatically processed
- Ask questions in natural language about any uploaded paper
- Get accurate answers with page citations so you can verify the source
- Choose explanation modes:
  - 🎓 Academic - Formal terminology with detailed analysis
  - ✨ Simple - Everyday language without jargon
  - 🧒 ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) - Explained like you're 5 with fun analogies
- Build a personal research library with multiple papers

---

## How we built it

1. Backend (FastAPI): Built a REST API with endpoints for uploading papers, listing them, deleting, and asking questions. Used async/await for efficient processing.

2. PDF Processing Pipeline: Used PyMuPDF to extract text page-by-page, implemented section detection (Abstract, Methods, etc.), and chunked documents with overlap for context preservation.

3. RAG System: Integrated Pinecone vector database for semantic search. Each chunk is embedded using HuggingFace's BGE model and stored with metadata.

4. LLM Integration: Connected to Groq's API for fast inference with LLaMA 3.3 70B. Built custom prompts for each explanation mode.

5. Frontend (Next.js): Created a modern, dark-themed UI with animated intro screen, real-time chat interface, and responsive sidebar for paper management.

---

## Challenges we ran into

1. Hydration Mismatch: Random particle positions in the intro animation caused server/client differences. Solved by using predefined positions.

2. Model Deprecation: The initial LLaMA 3.1 model was decommissioned mid-development. Had to quickly switch to LLaMA 3.3.

3. Chunk Boundary Issues: Important information often split across chunks. Solved with overlapping chunks (100 character overlap).

4. Citation Accuracy: Ensuring page numbers matched the actual PDF required careful metadata tracking through the entire pipeline.

5. UI Responsiveness: Balancing the sidebar, chat area, and input box positioning for different screen sizes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Page-accurate citations - Every answer includes exact page references users can verify
- Three explanation modes - Making research accessible to everyone from experts to beginners
- Beautiful animated UI - Galaxy-themed design with smooth transitions and intro animation
- Fast responses - Groq's LPU delivers answers in seconds, not minutes
- Clean architecture - Modular code with separate services for LLM, vector store, and document processing

---

## What we learned

- RAG is powerful but needs tuning - Chunk size, overlap, and retrieval count significantly affect answer quality
- Vector databases - How semantic search works and how to structure metadata for filtering
- LLM Prompting - Different prompts dramatically change output quality and style
- Real-time UX - The importance of loading states, animations, and feedback for user experience
- PDF complexity - Text extraction is harder than expected with varying layouts and formats

---

## What's next for ResearchGPT

1. Multi-paper queries - Ask questions across your entire research library
2. Highlighted PDF viewer - Show the exact text being cited in context
3. Citation export - Generate bibliography entries in various formats
4. Collaborative features - Share papers and insights with team members
5. Paper summarization - Auto-generate abstracts and key takeaways
6. Comparison mode - Compare findings across multiple papers
7. Mobile app - Read and query papers on the go
